# Prototype Shield for STM32F746NG-DISCO

EAGLE schematic and layout files for a simple prototyping shield designed for
the STM32F746NG Discovery board, connecting to the Arduino-like connectors.

The shield matches in width the usual Arduino shields, but it is 8cm long to
match the width of the discovery board. The shield is mostly filled with
prototyping holes, but there is room for an SMD IC (1.27 or 0.65mm pitch)
and some SOT-23 tranzistors.
